# TinyBytes

TinyBites makes use of the block chain technology by having a central node that takes in files and distributes them to a valid block state. The central node then employs an API to send the needed information to recreate the hash. The winning miner receives a reward for finding a proper hash. The reward size is directly dependent on the size of the data and the difficulty of the hash. Users can send their rewards to other users.
